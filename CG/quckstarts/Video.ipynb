The flying squirrel flies back to the chinchilla and the fox, who are holding a walnut and three buckeyes respectively.  The three decide to prank the bunny, so the flying squirrel snatches the apple again and places it back beneath the apple tree. Then, the fox throws the three buckeyes at the bunny, who ducks down to avoid being hit. The flying squirrel throws the walnut at the bunny, who ducks again.\n",
